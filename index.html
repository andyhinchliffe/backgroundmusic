      <div id="about" class="info"><strong><b>About   </b></strong><br />Early in 2020 the Covid19 crisis hit the UK, over night our livelihood as producers, DJs and music creators  disappeared along with some of our favourite venues. As lock down started to ease many of the local venues started to report they were struggling financially with the new restrictions. Our solution to both of these problems was to start to build a huge library of new music from Sheffield producers which we could continually update and stream directly into the spaces we love. We get an outlet for our music and as it is all original and royalty free the venues using Sound Union are not required to have a music license, saving them money and hopefully helping them stay afloat in these difficult times.</div>
      <div class="info"><strong><b>Royalty Free Music</b></strong><br />Royalty-free music refers to a type of music licensing that allows businesses to use copyrighted music without the need for ongoing royalty payments or license fees. It provides a cost-effective solution for businesses that want to incorporate background music in their premises.<br /> By utilizing royalty-free music, businesses can save money that would otherwise be spent on obtaining licenses for commercial music or paying for streaming services. Instead, they can access a wide variety of high-quality music tracks through royalty-free libraries or streaming platforms for free.</div>
